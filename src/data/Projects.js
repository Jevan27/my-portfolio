      "PetPal FeedSync is a smart pet feeder that lets owners manage and monitor their petsâ€™ meals from anywhere. It uses an RFID tag on each pet to recognize them, opens their assigned food drawer, and measures the right amount with a built-in scale. Owners can schedule feedings, dispense food instantly, and watch their pets live through a camera. All feeding history is saved online for easy tracking.",
